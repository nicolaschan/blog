Thanks for stopping by my corner of the internet! 🌐

I'm a software engineer in San Francisco. Currently I work at Microsoft on [Yammer](https://yammer.com) backend microservices.

I studied computer science and mathematics at UC Berkeley (class of '21). I spent much of my time working at UC Berkeley’s Savio Supercomputer. I also dabbled in program synthesis for undergrad research.

Outside of work, I enjoy hobby coding on GitHub, cycling, and swimming in the bay. On this blog I intend to share whatever comes to mind. There is no schedule or goal here, just writing for fun!
