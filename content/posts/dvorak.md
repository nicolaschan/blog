I started using [the Dvorak keyboard layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout) in middle school. Here are my thoughts as a full-time Dvorak typist ten years later.

## Observations

- I'm not much faster than my peak Qwerty speed, if at all (&asymp;110 WPM). Not the fastest, but it's more than sufficient for my needs because my typing speed usually exceeds my thinking speed.

- My Qwerty speed has degraded since peak, but not terribly. My Qwerty speed is around 70 WPM. This is good considering how rarely I use it.

- I love Vim keybindings. But my muscle memory is for _Dvorak_ Vim bindings. In Qwerty, the Vim movement keys are all together: `HJKL`. But in Dvorak, this would be the on the physical Qwerty keys labeled `JCVP`. By pure coincidence, this works out to be fine since the `C-V` keys are Down-Up and `J-P` are Left-Right. It's not how Vim was intended, but it works well enough for me.

- I'm a touch typist so there is no need to relabel the keys. The only thing I might occasionally look at are the symbols above the numbers, which Dvorak leaves unchanged anyway. After typing a lot of $\LaTeX$, I have also memorized a lot of symbols.

- I recently switched to using caps lock as control. This is definitely an improvement for combos like `Ctrl-A`.

## Pros

- I never get finger fatigue, even after typing for long periods. This might not be completely due to Dvorak, but it probably doesn't hurt that my finger movement is less than it would be otherwise. When comparing with Qwerty I _definitely_ notice that my fingers travel a lot less in Dvorak.

- While Dvorak is never the default, it is widely supported. Linux, Windows, and Mac all have it out of the box with no special software needed. This is a reason you might choose Dvorak over Colemak, until Colemak makes it into Windows.

- I have automatic deterrence if someone tries to mess with my computer while I'm away. &#x1F608;

## Cons

- Keyboard shortcuts are moved but it's also not a big deal. Some alternate keyboard users remap the shortcuts to keep them in the same place they would be physically on Qwerty. I can't be bothered, so I just use the Dvorak equivalents. It is less convenient not having copy and paste next to each other, but I'm used to it now.

- It's a lonely life. I haven't yet met another Dvorak user in person (at least to my knowledge). The closest I know are Colemak users. We are rare, but that also makes us special.

## Conclusion

Do the pros outweigh the cons? For me, just barely. The pros are not very strong, but nor are the cons. I wouldn't switch back to Qwerty since I'm now used to Dvorak and Dvorak feels more ergonomic. 

If I were to have to make the choice again, I'd do it just to be special. &#x1F643;
