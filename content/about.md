Thanks for stopping by my corner of the internet! &#x1F310;

I'm a software engineer based in San Francisco. I graduated UC Berkeley in 2021 where I studied computer science and mathematics. Much of my time was spent working at [UC Berkeley's Savio Supercomputer](https://docs-research-it.berkeley.edu/services/high-performance-computing/overview/). I also dabbled in program synthesis for undergrad research. Outside of work, I enjoy playing piano and hobby coding on [GitHub](https://github.com/nicolaschan).

On this blog I intend to share whatever comes to mind. There is no schedule or goal here, just writing for fun!
